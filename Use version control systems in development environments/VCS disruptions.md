# VCS disruptions

The impact of installing a Version Control System (VCS) on development team will likely be positive in the long run, but there can be some potential disruptions and downtime in the short term. Here's a breakdown of what to expect:

## Potential Disruptions

- **Learning Curve**: The development team will need to learn the VCS tool (e.g., Git) and its workflows. This can lead to a temporary decrease in productivity as they become familiar with the new system.
- **Process Changes**: VCS adoption necessitates changes to development workflows. Developers will need to adapt to practices like committing code regularly, branching for features, and resolving merge conflicts.
- **Initial Setup**: Setting up the VCS server or cloud repository, and migrating existing code can take some time, potentially causing minor disruptions.

## Downtime

- **Minimal Downtime Expected**: In most cases, the VCS setup shouldn't cause significant downtime for the development team. They can continue working on local copies of the codebase while the initial setup is done.
- **Potential Downtime During Migration**: If migrating a large existing codebase, there might be a short period of downtime while the data is transferred to the VCS repository.

## Minimizing Disruption

- **Training & Support**: Providing proper training and support to the development team during the VCS adoption process can significantly reduce disruptions.
- **Phased Rollout**: Consider a phased rollout, allowing developers to get comfortable with the VCS on a smaller project before migrating everything.
- **Clear Communication**: Keep the development team informed throughout the process, explaining the benefits and potential challenges of VCS adoption.

## Overall Impact

While there might be some initial hurdles, installing a VCS is a positive step for most development teams. The long-term benefits like improved collaboration, version history, and easier code management far outweigh the short-term disruptions.

> **Phased Rollout**: refers to a strategy of gradually releasing a new feature, update, or system to a user base or development team
