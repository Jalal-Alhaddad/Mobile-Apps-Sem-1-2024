## `.gitignore`

- The `.gitignore` file instructs Git on which files or directories to exclude from version control
- It helps maintain a cleaner repository by excluding files like compiled binaries, temporary files, and configuration files specific to individual environments, preventing them from being unintentionally committed
- Improving collaboration efficiency.

## Double quotation marks around text

In some Git commands, using double quotation marks around text is necessary, especially when the text includes spaces or special characters
