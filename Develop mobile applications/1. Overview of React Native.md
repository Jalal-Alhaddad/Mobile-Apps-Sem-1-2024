# 1. Overview of React Native

## 1. What is React Native?

- React Native is an open-source framework developed by Facebook for building mobile applications using JavaScript and React.
- React Native allows developers to write code once and deploy it across both platform

## 2. Differences between React and React Native

- **Platform Targets**:
  - React: Primarily used for building web applications.
  - React Native: Specifically designed for building mobile applications on iOS and Android.
- **Rendering**:
  - React: Utilizes HTML, CSS, and the DOM (Document Object Model) for rendering.
  - React Native: Does not use HTML or CSS; instead, it uses native components such as <View>, <Text>, and <Image>, which are translated to platform-specific components.
- **Styling**:
  - React: Styling is done using CSS or CSS-in-JS libraries.
  - React Native: Styling is done using JavaScript objects with a styling system similar to CSS but not exactly the same (e.g., using StyleSheet.create()).

## 3. Benefits of using React Native for mobile development

- **Cross-Platform Development**: Write code once and deploy it on both iOS and Android, saving time and effort.
- **Performance**: Offers near-native performance as it uses native components rather than web components.
- **Reusable Components**: Allows for the creation of reusable components, enhancing code maintainability and readability.
- **Hot Reloading**: Enables developers to see the results of the latest change immediately without recompiling the entire application, speeding up the development process.
- **Strong Community and Ecosystem**: A vast community of developers, numerous libraries, and third-party plugins are available, providing ample resources and support.
- **Backed by Facebook**: Continuous support and updates from Facebook ensure that the framework evolves with the latest technological advancements.

## 4. Setting Up the Environment

### Installing Node.js and npm

- Ensure `Node.js` and `npm` (Node Package Manager) are installed on your system. These are essential for managing packages and running React Native applications.
- Download and install `Node.js` from nodejs.org
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)  It is a **package manager** that allows you to install and manage dependencies for your Node.js applications, it includes a CLI for interacting with the npm registry
- **npx** (Node Package Execute) It is a **package runner** tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and is used to execute Node.js packages.

### Create a new React Native project

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest --template
```

- `-- template` is useful to select a template, in out case will choose blank
- Then name your project

### Packages required to run the mobile app in the browser

```bash
npx expo install react-native-web react-dom @expo/metro-runtime
```

### Exploring the project structure

### Run the app

```bash
npx expo start        # start the app
npx expo start --web  # start the app in the web browser environment

npm run web           # start the app in the web browser environment
```
