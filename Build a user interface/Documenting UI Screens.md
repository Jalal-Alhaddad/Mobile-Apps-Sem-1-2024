# Documenting UI Screens

## Wireframe Documentation

- **Text Document**: A simple text document can list out screen elements, their functionality, and brief notes on interactions.
- **Spreadsheet**: Similar to a text document, a spreadsheet can organize information in a tabular format for easy sorting and filtering.

## Mockup & Prototype Documentation

- **Design Tool Notes**: Most design tools (e.g., Figma, Sketch) allow adding notes directly on screen elements. This is a great way to capture details specific to each element.
- **Style Guide**: A style guide defines the visual language of the UI, including colors, fonts, and UI component styles. This ensures a cohesive look across all screens.

## UI Screen Contents

- **Screen Name**: Clearly identify the name or purpose of the screen.
- **Wireframe Annotations**: Briefly describe the purpose and functionality of each UI element on the wireframe.
- **User Interaction**: Explain how users will interact with each element (e.g., click, tap, hover).
- **Content Examples**: Provide example text, icons, or images for content placeholders.
- **Error Handling**: Document how the UI will handle errors or invalid user input.
- **Accessibility Notes**: Consider including notes on how the UI will be accessible for users with disabilities.
- **Style Guide References**: Mention relevant sections of the style guide for colors, fonts, and component styles used on the screen.

## Storyboards in UI/UX Documentation

- **Visualizing User Flows**: Storyboards are sequences of images that depict the steps a user takes to complete a task within the app.
- **Transition Focus**: They excel at showing transitions between screens and UI states, making them ideal for complex interactions.
- **Follow the User Journey**: Each storyboard should focus on a specific user journey or task within the app.
- **Sequence of Screens**: Break down the journey into a series of panels, depicting each screen the user interacts with.
- **Annotations & Note**s: Include annotations on each panel explaining the user's actions, system responses, and UI changes.
