## 1 Overview of Software Requirements Analysis

### 1.1 Definition

- **Definition**: Software Requirements Analysis is the process of gathering, documenting, and managing the requirements for a software system.
- **Importance**: It forms the foundation for a successful software project by ensuring clear objectives and expectations.

#### 1.1.1 Requirement Definitions

Requirement definitions may vary depending on the domain and source, whether it is software requirements or engineering requirements. The following are some definitions from different sources and books:

> "A condition or capability to which a system must conform."

Source: The Rational Unified Process by Phillipe Kruchten

> "A specification of what should be implemented."

Source: Requirements Engineering: A Good Practice Guide by Ian Sommerville and Pete Sawyer

> "A property a product must have to provide value to stakeholders."

Source: Software Requirements by Karl Weigers and Joy Beatty

> "Anything that drives design choices."

Source: "Requirement Happens," American Programmer, by Brian Lawrence

#### 1.1.2 Requirement Categories

Different categories of requirements serve various purposes in a project:

1. **Business Requirement**: High-level objectives that align with the overall business goals.
   - Solve a business problem
   - Improve a business process
   - Exploit business opportunity
2. **Business Rule**: Policies, standards, or regulations that dictate how the business operates.
3. **Functional Requirement**: Specifies the desired behavior and functionalities of the system.
4. **Nonfunctional Requirement**: Encompasses various system characteristics, including quality, maintainability, usability, performance, and security.
5. **External interface requirement**: System integration
6. **Constraint**: Developer choices

### 1.2 Role in SDLC

Integral throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), from initiation to maintenance.

#### SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

SDLC, or Software Development Life Cycle, is a systematic process used by software developers to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain high-quality software products. It outlines a series of phases that guide the development team through the entire life cycle of a software project, from initial conception to its eventual retirement. The typical phases in SDLC include Planning, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. Each phase has specific goals, deliverables, and activities, ensuring a structured and well-managed approach to software development. The SDLC framework provides a roadmap for developers to follow, helping ensure that the final software product meets the desired quality standards and satisfies customer requirements.

#### SDLC Key Stages

- Initiation: Identifying the need and objectives.
- Planning: Outlining the approach for requirements analysis.
- Analysis: Detailing and documenting requirements.
- Design, Implementation, Testing, and Maintenance: Building and refining based on requirements.

### 1.3 Terms and Concepts

- **Requirement**: A feature or characteristic that a system must have.
- **Stakeholder**: Individuals or groups with an interest in the project.
- **Traceability**: Mapping requirements to design and testing.
- **Clear and Concise Documentation**: Essential for effective communication.
- **Iterative Process**: Requirements evolve throughout the project.

## 2 Software Development Methodologies

### 2.1 Traditional Methodologies

- Emphasize a linear, structured approach.
- Example: Waterfall model.

Traditional Development, often referred to as the Waterfall model, is a linear and structured approach to software development. In this methodology, the entire project is divided into distinct phases, including requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each phase must be completed before progressing to the next, making it a sequential process. Traditional Development is best suited for projects with stable and well-defined requirements, where changes are expected to be minimal. Once a phase is completed, it becomes challenging to revisit without returning to the beginning, making it less adaptable to changes during the development process.

### 2.2 Agile Methodologies

- Emphasize iterative and collaborative development.
- Examples: Scrum, Kanban.

Agile Development is an iterative and adaptive approach to software development that prioritizes collaboration, adaptability, and customer satisfaction. In this methodology, the project is divided into small, manageable increments known as iterations or sprints. Each iteration results in a potentially shippable product increment, allowing for continuous improvement throughout the development process. Agile encourages close collaboration between cross-functional teams, including developers, testers, and business representatives. It is well-suited for projects with evolving or unclear requirements, where regular client feedback is essential. Agile embraces change and focuses on delivering small, incremental improvements in short time frames, promoting flexibility and responsiveness in the development process.

#### Scrum

> Iterative and incremental, organized into sprints with defined roles.

- **Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
- **Sprints**: Time-boxed iterations for development.
- **Artifacts**: Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment.
- **Benefits**: Transparency, adaptability, and customer satisfaction.

#### Kanban

> Visualizes workflow, emphasizes continuous delivery, and minimizes work in progress.

- **Visual Board**: Represents work stages.
- **WIP Limits**: Controls work in progress.
- **Continuous Delivery**: Focus on constant improvement.
- **Benefits**: Flexibility, efficiency, and minimal bottlenecks.

### 2.3 Agile Principles and Values

- **Agile Principles**
  - Customer satisfaction through continuous delivery.
  - Embracing change for customer advantage.
- **Agile Values**
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
  - Responding to change over following a plan.

## 4 Role of User Stories in Agile Frameworks

### 4.1 Definition and structure of user stories

- **Definition**: User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from an end-user perspective.
- **Structure**:
  - ```As a [user type], I want [an action] so that [benefit]```
  - Example: "As a customer, I want to easily navigate the website, so I can find products quickly."

### 4.2 Significance in agile development

- **Visual Representation**: Often represented on Agile boards, enhancing visibility.

### 4.4 Examples and Best Practices

- **Example User Stories**
  - "As a blog reader, I want to comment on posts to share my thoughts."
  - "As a project manager, I want to view team progress to track project milestones."
- **Best Practices**
  - Keep user stories small and focused.
  - Prioritize based on user value.

## 5 Understanding the Importance of TELOS in Project Feasibility

### 5.1 Explanation of TELOS components (Technical, Economic, Legal, Operational, Scheduling)

> **TELOS**, an acronym encompassing **T**echnical, **E**conomic, **L**egal, **O**perational, and **S**cheduling considerations, **is a vital framework for evaluating project feasibility** in project management. It allows for a comprehensive evaluation of a project's feasibility by examining its technical requirements, economic viability, legal compliance, operational processes, and scheduling constraints
