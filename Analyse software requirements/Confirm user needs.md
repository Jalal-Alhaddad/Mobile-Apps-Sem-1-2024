## Questions

### In-scope and out-of-scope

> **Out-of-scope** items are aspects that will not be addressed in the initial release but may be considered for implementation in subsequent phases or versions.

- **When** the client or stakeholder communicates specific requirements that fall outside the defined project scope, it is essential to **confirm and clarify** these statements
- **When** the customer mentions requirements for a later stage or future phases, it is crucial to **determine** whether these requirements fall within the current project scope or are considered for a subsequent phase.
- In-scope and out-of-scope questions are **crucial** during the early stages of a project as they help define and confirm the project **boundaries**.
- They ensure that both the **project team** and **stakeholders** have a clear **understanding** of what will be included in the project and what will not.
- **Avoids misunderstandings**: Confirming out-of-scope requirements helps prevent misunderstandings and misinterpretations of client expectations.
- **Clarity in documentation**: Ensures that the project documentation accurately reflects the agreed-upon scope and boundaries.
- **Facilitates communication**: Promotes clear communication between the project team and stakeholders, fostering a shared understanding of project goals.
