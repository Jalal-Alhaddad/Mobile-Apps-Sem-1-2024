**Requirement Development** involves activities related to the creation, identification, and refinement of software requirements during the early stages of a project. This includes gathering, documenting, and analyzing requirements to ensure a clear understanding of what the software system needs to accomplish

**Requirement Management** refers to the ongoing process of planning, monitoring, and controlling the changes to requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. It involves activities to prioritize, estimate, schedule, and track requirements to ensure they align with project goals

## Requirement Development

- **Elicit**: Gather requirements from stakeholders.
- **Specify**: Clearly define and document identified requirements.
- **Analyze**: Evaluate and assess requirements to ensure alignment with project goals and objectives.
- **Validate**: Ensure that specified requirements meet the intended purpose.

### Scope Creep

> Scope creep refers to the unauthorized expansion or addition of features, functionalities, or requirements to a project beyond its initially defined boundaries.

- **Causes**
  - **Unclear Requirements**: Lack of clarity or specificity in initial requirements may lead to misinterpretation and subsequent scope changes.
  - **Changing Stakeholder Expectations**: Evolving stakeholder needs or expectations that were not adequately addressed in the initial project scope.
  - **Inadequate Change Control**: Absence or inadequacy of change control mechanisms can result in unmanaged scope changes.
- **Impact**
  - **Timeline Delays**: Scope creep can lead to project delays as additional work may require more time than initially planned.
  - **Budget Overruns**: Extra work means additional costs, potentially exceeding the originally allocated budget.
  - **Quality Issues**: Rushed implementations due to scope changes may compromise the overall quality of the software.
- **Mitigation**
  - **Effective Change Control**: Implementing a robust change control process to evaluate, approve, and manage scope changes.
  - **Clear Requirements**: Ensuring that requirements are well-defined and thoroughly reviewed by stakeholders.
  - **Regular Communication**: Maintaining open communication channels to address evolving stakeholder expectations promptly.

## Requirement Management

- **Prioritize**: Assign priority levels to requirements based on their importance.
- **Estimate**: Determine the effort and resources required for implementing each requirement.
- **Schedule**: Allocate time-frames for the development and implementation of requirements.
- **Track**: Monitor and manage the progress of requirement development throughout the project.

### Requirement Management in Scrum

- **Prioritize**: Utilize the `Product Backlog` to arrange and prioritize product requirements.
- **Estimate**: Employ `Planning Poker` to estimate the effort required for each backlog item.
- **Schedule**: Create the `Sprint Backlog` to outline and schedule tasks for a specific sprint.
- **Track**: Use the `Burndown Chart` to monitor and visualize the progress of completing tasks throughout the sprint.

### Enterprise Agile Planning Tools

EAP tools are software applications designed to aid organizations in implementing and managing agile methodologies at scale. They cater to the specific needs of large enterprises transitioning towards agile development or those already using it but facing challenges with managing multiple teams, projects, and dependencies.

- **Key functionalities**
  - **Centralized backlog management**: Create, prioritize, and manage a comprehensive list of user stories, features, and other work items across various teams and projects.
  - **Visual roadmapping**: Visualize the overall product roadmap, plan releases, and track progress towards goals.
  - **Team collaboration**: Facilitate communication and collaboration between diverse teams working on different aspects of a project.
  - **Dependency management**: Identify and manage dependencies between work items to ensure smooth workflow and avoid bottlenecks.
  - **Reporting and analytics**: Generate reports and analyze data to gain insights into team performance, project progress, and identify areas for improvement.
- **EAP tools usage**
  - **Capture and refine requirements**: EAP tools offer features to capture user stories, features, and other requirements in a central location, allowing for easy access, collaboration, and refinement by stakeholders.
  - **Prioritize requirements**: EAP tools enable teams to collaboratively prioritize requirements based on business value, customer needs, and feasibility.
  - **Traceability**: EAP tools can track the relationship between requirements, design documents, and test cases, ensuring requirements are effectively implemented and tested.
  - **Communication and transparency**: EAP tools facilitate communication between stakeholders by providing a shared platform to discuss, clarify, and validate requirements.
- **Benefits of EAP tools**
  - Improved requirement clarity and consistency
  - Enhanced collaboration and communication among stakeholders
  - Efficient prioritization and better resource allocation
  - Increased visibility and control over the entire development process
  - Faster time to market and improved product quality

## Scrum Terms

- **Product Backlog**
  - Definition: A prioritized list of all features, enhancements, and fixes for a product. It serves as the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.
  - Purpose: To provide a dynamic and organized way to manage and prioritize work items, ensuring the team is aligned with the product's goals.
- **Planning Poker**
  - Definition: An estimation technique where team members assign a numerical value to each story point or user story, often using a deck of cards with specific values.
  - Purpose: To achieve consensus on the level of effort required for a particular task, allowing for better planning and resource allocation.
- **Sprint Backlog**
  - Definition: A subset of the Product Backlog containing user stories and tasks selected for a specific sprint. It outlines the work that needs to be done during the sprint.
  - Purpose: To provide a focused plan for the team to achieve the sprint goal and deliver a potentially shippable product increment.
- **Burndown Chart**
  - Definition: A visual representation of work completed versus work remaining over time in a sprint. It tracks the progress of tasks and helps the team assess if they are on track to complete the sprint goals.
  - Purpose: To provide a transparent view of the team's progress, enabling them to adapt and make informed decisions during the sprint.
